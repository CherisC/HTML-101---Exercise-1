    Here's what I like about lists:

    <ul>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff
        That's about it
        I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool
    </ul>
    When you make a list, do it in this order:

    <ol>Decide if it's an ordered list or not
        If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag
        Use li tags nested in the list for your list items
        <ul>Curveball! You can nest list inside each other</ul>
        You've got this, I believe in you!
    </ol>
